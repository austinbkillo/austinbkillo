Hi! I'm Austin Killough, a Software Engineer in the Southern California area. My stack is JavaScript, React, and Node.js with Express, but I love learning new tech.
I am looking for a full time role with a team who is as excited about learning and improving as I am.
If you have any questions, opportunities, or just want to chat, I am reachable at 714-916-8507 or austinbkillough@gmail.com

https://github.com/austinbkillo/FEC-Catwalk - Catwalk is an e-commerce platform front-end, created with React.

https://github.com/austinbkillo/Ruby This is the backend for the same e-commerce platform - matching legacy endpoints and horizontally scaled and load balanced on AWS and NginX.
