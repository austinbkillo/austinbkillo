Hi! I'm Austin Killough, a Software Engineer in the Southern California area. My stack is JavaScript, React, and Node.js with Express, but I love learning new tech.
I am looking for a full time role with a team who is as excited about learning and improving as I am.
If you have any questions, opportunities, or just want to chat, I am reachable at 714-916-8507 or austinbkillough@gmail.com
